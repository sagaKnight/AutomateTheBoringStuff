1. PyInputPlus does not come with the PSL, it is a module that is downloaded. ✓
2. So we don't have to type up pyinputplus everytime we want to use the module. ✓
3. Float allows for the decimal point, int just uses the numbers. ✓ (Float will always give decimal point*)
4. We can use pyip.inputInt('Input a number between 0 and 99', greaterThan 0, lessThan 100) X (min=0, max=99 my greaterThan also is wrong.)
5. The expression is sent as the argument X (Weird question)
6. It will give an error exception and stop running. ✓Half (RetryLimitException)
7. It will use the default value of 'hello' ✓
