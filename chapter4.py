1. The '[]' is the square brackets which indicates a list data type. /t
2. spam[2] = 'hello' /t
3. Equates to 0 /f '3' * 2 = 33 since its a string. Then 33/11 = spam[3] which would've outputed 'd'
4. 'd' /t
5. ['d'] /f ['a','b'] since spam[:2] would've asked from 0 to 2.
6. 1 /t
7. adds 99 to the end of the list. /t
8. [3.14, 11, True] /f only deletes the first 'cat' it finds in the delete()
9. + operator, * operator respectively /t
10. append adds to the end of a list. Insert method can add to any index of a list. /t
11. .remove() or replacing the value. /f del statement was missing.
12. list values and string values are able to do all of the same methods. /t
13. tuples are immuteable, meaning that they cannot be changed without also changing its memory. Lists stay in the same id and are muteable. /t
14. tupleValue('42') /f it is (42,) with a mandatory on the trailing comma.
15. You are able to change the tuple form through the tuple() method similar to a str() /t
16. A reference to the list value. /t
17. The difference is that a .copy copies the reference, and a deepcopy hard copies the value itself and makes new space on memory. /f shallow copy creates a new object and
    copies references to the new object. Deep copy, copies everything and makes everything new, doesn't rely on the reference any longer.
