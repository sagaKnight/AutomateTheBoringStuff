Chapter 7 Notes

- Regular expressions (regexes) are descriptions for a pattern of text.
- \d is called a digit character. This can be used instead of an int literal. We can use
\d to represent any number from 0 - 9.
- We can use braces after a pattern to say, match this regex multiple times. E.g.
\d{3} is saying \d\d\d
